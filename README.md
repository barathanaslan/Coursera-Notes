# Coursera-Notes
Personally taken notes from different courses on coursera.

This repository contains my personal notes (PDFs) and screenshots taken while studying two specialization courses by deeplearning.ai (Andrew Ng) on Coursera. The notes are organized in course-specific folders. I prepared these notes using [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/).
